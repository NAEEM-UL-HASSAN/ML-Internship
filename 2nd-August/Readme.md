# Specialist Recommendation System using RAG

This repository contains a Gradio-based web application that recommends medical specialists based on user-provided symptoms. The app uses a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) technique, combining embeddings from a pre-trained transformer model and approximate nearest neighbors (ANN) retrieval to find the most relevant specialists.

## Requirements

- Python 3.7 or higher
- Required libraries:
  - pandas
  - sentence-transformers
  - faiss-cpu
  - gradio

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/NAEEM-UL-HASSAN/ML-Internship.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd 2nd-August
    ```

3. Open the provided Notebook file (i.e Pre_Diagnose_Disease.ipynb).

4. Run each cell one by one.

5. Now give symptoms as a input and get the specialist doctor against the given symptoms.
